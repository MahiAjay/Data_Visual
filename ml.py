# pandas and numpy do not relate to machine learning . It comes under data engineering. 
# Machine learning is all about testing training data and prediction of data. Relates to human learning.
#Many documantations and subdivisions are there in ml
# But we will focus only on     - Supervised
# #                                - Regression:                   ___________
#                                    Linear regression =>         |y = mx + c| 
#---- In linear regression we use only one feature                -----------
#---- on which the model is performed. The data is
#---- of two types which are dependent data and independent data.                     
#     We basically give data which acts as the data points in the 
#     graph and the linear regression model draws the lines in the
#     graph. Now when we predict and analyse to the nearest line of the desired point. #         
                                      
# #                                - Classification
#                               - Unsupervised
